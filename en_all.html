<p>9270,Cimetidine : In the presence of cimetidine at # mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of gabapentin fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%.</p>
<p>9271,"Thus cimetidine appeared to alter the renal excretion of both gabapentin and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function."</p>
<p>9272,This small decrease in excretion of gabapentin by cimetidine is not expected to be of clinical importance.</p>
<p>9273,The effect of gabapentin on cimetidine was not evaluated.</p>

<p>9283,Antacid ( Maalox ): Maalox reduced the bioavailability of gabapentin (N=16) by about 20%.</p>
<p>9284,This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when gabapentin was administered # hours after Maalox .</p>
<p>9285,It is recommended that gabapentin be taken at least # hours following Maalox administration.</p>
<p>9286,Gabapentin pharmacokinetic parameters without and with probenecid were comparable.</p>
<p>9287,This indicates that gabapentin does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by probenecid .</p>
<p>9288,"Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG dipstick test for urinary protein when gabapentin was added to other antiepileptic_drugs , the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein"</p>
